                  <strong>Tell your caretakers everything they need to know about your religious and cultural preferences. If you encounter a hospital employee who is not wearing an ID badge or who does not introduce himself or herself to you, ask them who they are and what they do at the hospital.<br>

                    All medical service providers should check your wrist band for specific medical instructions before administering a test or treatment.<br>
                    Ask when you can expect your test results, and if you aren’t informed about them at that time, ask again — you need to know what your caretakers have found out about your condition.
